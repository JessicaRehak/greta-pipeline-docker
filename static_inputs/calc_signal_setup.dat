# configuration file for signal calculation 
# time specific stuff (fields & geometry have separate setup files)
# time steps used in calculation and output should be related by
# integer (compression) factor for best results
500    # number of time steps used in calculations
1.0    # length of time step, ns
50     # number of time steps in output signal
